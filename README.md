## 🛠️ Installation

To get the Virtual Assistant up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-assistant.git
    cd virtual-assistant
    ```

2.  **Install server dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Install client dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

**IDE Recommendation:**
For the best development experience, it is recommended to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory and populate it with the following variables:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/virtual_assistant_db
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
# Add other environment variables as needed (e.g., API keys for external services)
```

## ▶️ Running Locally

1.  **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified `PORT`).

2.  **Start the frontend client:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    ```
    The client application will open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 💡 Usage

Once both the client and server are running, you can access the Virtual Assistant through your web browser. Interact by typing commands or queries into the designated input area. The assistant will process your input and provide responses or perform actions. The application is designed to be intuitive for any user.

## 🔗 API Examples

The backend provides a RESTful API for managing interactions and data.

*   **`POST /api/commands`**: Send a command or query to the virtual assistant.

    ```http
    POST /api/commands
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "query": "What is the weather like today?"
    }
    ```

*   **`GET /api/history`**: Retrieve the interaction history.

    ```http
    GET /api/history
    ```

*   **`POST /api/auth/register`**: Register a new user (if authentication is implemented).

    ```http
    POST /api/auth/register
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "username": "user123",
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "password": "securepassword"
    }
    ```

## 🖼️ Screenshots

## 🧪 Testing

_Instructions for running tests will be provided here. For a MERN stack, this would typically involve unit tests for client/server components and integration tests._

```bash
# Example for running server tests
cd server
npm test

# Example for running client tests
cd client
npm test
```

## 🚀 Deployment

_This section will contain instructions or links to guides on how to deploy the Virtual Assistant to production environments (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, AWS, DigitalOcean)._

## 🗺️ Roadmap

*   Implement advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.
*   Integrate with external APIs (e.g., weather, news, calendar).
*   Add user authentication and personalized profiles.
*   Enhance UI/UX with more interactive elements.
*   Develop mobile application support.
